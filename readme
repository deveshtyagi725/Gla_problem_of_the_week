## 📌 Problems Included

### 🔻 1. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

**🔍 Description:**  
You're given a sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown pivot. The task is to find the minimum element in this rotated array.

**📖 Concepts Used:**  
- Binary Search  
- Array Traversal  
- Pivot Detection  

**📊 Difficulty:** Medium  
**🧩 Category:** Searching & Sorting

### ➕ 2. Subarray Sum Equals K

**🔍 Description:**  
Given an integer array and a number `k`, the task is to find the **total number of continuous subarrays** whose sum equals `k`.

**📖 Concepts Used:**  
- Prefix Sum  
- HashMap for optimized lookup  
- Sliding Window logic (conceptually)

**📊 Difficulty:** Medium  
**🧩 Category:** Array & Hashing

### 🏠 3. Ruby's Second House

**🔍 Description:**  
Ruby wants to rob houses along a street but can’t rob two adjacent ones. The goal is to calculate the maximum amount she can rob without setting off alarms.

**📖 Concepts Used:**  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Decision Making (Rob or Skip)  
- Space Optimization (optional)

**📊 Difficulty:** Medium  
**🧩 Category:** DP Variant (House Robber)
